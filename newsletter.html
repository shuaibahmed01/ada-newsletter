            <p>The article discusses proposed legislation to delay the filing deadline for the Corporate Transparency Act, which affects many small businesses, including dental practices. Rep. Zachary Nunn introduced H.R. 9278 in September 2024, aiming to extend the deadline by one year for businesses to file beneficial ownership information reports with the U.S. Department of Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. The American Dental Association (ADA), along with 150 other trade associations, supports this legislation, citing low submission rates and lack of awareness among small businesses about the requirements. The Corporate Transparency Act, originally intended to combat money laundering, has faced criticism for its short reporting timeframe. While a similar bill (H.R. 5119) passed the House in 2023 with ADA's support, it has stalled in the Senate, prompting this new legislative effort to provide relief to affected businesses before they face potential penalties at the end of the year.</p>

            <p class="article-meta"><strong>Olivia Anderson - September 12, 2024</strong></p>
            <p>The article discusses the American Dental Association's (ADA) comments on proposed Medicare payment policies for dental services in 2025, submitted to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). The ADA supports CMS's proposal to cover dental services for end-stage renal disease patients undergoing dialysis and requests inclusion in future reviews of scientific evidence related to medically necessary dental benefits. The association addresses several key areas, including the role of dental care for diabetic patients, the implementation of ICD-10 codes for Medicare claims, and the need for clear guidance on care coordination between physicians and dentists. The ADA recommends delaying certain requirements, such as administrative claim modifiers and ICD-10 coding, until January 1, 2026, to allow for comprehensive testing and a smooth transition. This marks the third consecutive year the ADA has provided feedback on Medicare dental coverage, highlighting the ongoing efforts to integrate dental and medical care under Medicare since 2022.</p>

            <p class="article-meta"><strong>Olivia Anderson - September 13, 2024</strong></p>
            <p>The article discusses a recent hearing held by a House of Representatives subcommittee on September 10, 2024, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974 and explore ways to protect and improve it. The main focus was on ERISA's impact on self-funded benefit plans, including dental insurance. The American Dental Association (ADA) submitted comments emphasizing the importance of allowing states to retain authority in regulating dental benefits, arguing against expanding ERISA preemption which could override state laws. Rep. Bob Good, R-Va., chairman of the committee, advocated for less government intervention in healthcare markets while supporting amendments to ERISA that protect private insurance. The hearing featured four policy experts and highlighted the ongoing debate between federal and state regulation of health and dental insurance, with potential implications for beneficiaries and the future of healthcare oversight.</p>

            <p>This article focuses on Dr. Natalia Chalmers, the first chief dental officer for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in the Office of the Administrator. Dr. Chalmers, a pediatric dentist with over 20 years of experience, began her role at CMS in August 2021 with the goal of improving oral health care and policy across various health programs.

Dr. Chalmers' primary objectives in her role include addressing health equity, improving access to dental care, and fostering partnerships and collaborations. Since joining CMS, she has been instrumental in launching initiatives such as the Oral Health Cross-Cutting Initiative and implementing electronic dental claims processing.

The main topic revolves around updates to standards for various dental education programs, including predoctoral, advanced general dentistry, and dental hygiene education. CODA will host a virtual hearing on October 10, 2024, from 5-6 p.m. CDT, where participants can comment on the proposed changes. Additionally, interested parties can submit comments online until December 1, 2024, for most standards, with an extended deadline of June 1, 2025, for orofacial pain education program standards. This process allows stakeholders to contribute to the development of dental education standards, potentially impacting the future of dental training and practice.</p>
