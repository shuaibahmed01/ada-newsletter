            <p class="article-meta"><strong>Olivia Anderson - September 12, 2024</strong></p>
            <p>The article discusses the American Dental Association's (ADA) comments on proposed Medicare payment policies for dental services in 2025. The main topic revolves around the ADA's formal submission to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) regarding the Physician Fee Schedule for 2025. This marks the third consecutive year of ADA's involvement in shaping Medicare's dental coverage policies. The ADA supports CMS's proposal to cover dental services for end-stage renal disease patients undergoing dialysis and requests clarification on various aspects, including claim submission processes and coding requirements. The association recommends delaying the implementation of certain administrative modifiers and ICD-10 codes until January 1, 2026, to allow for a smoother transition. Additionally, the ADA offers its expertise in reviewing scientific evidence for medically necessary dental benefits and proposes the adoption of a standardized referral form to improve care coordination between medical and dental providers. This ongoing collaboration between the ADA and CMS aims to develop sustainable, evidence-based policies that enhance care for Medicare beneficiaries while addressing the needs of dental professionals.</p>

            <h2>Legislation needed to delay Corporate Transparency Act filing deadline</h2>

            <p class="article-meta"><strong>Olivia Anderson - September 10, 2024</strong></p>
            <p>The article discusses proposed legislation to delay the Corporate Transparency Act's filing deadline for small businesses, including many dental practices. Rep. Zachary Nunn introduced H.R. 9278, which would extend the deadline by one year, giving affected businesses more time to comply with reporting requirements to the U.S. Department of Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. The American Dental Association (ADA), along with 150 other trade associations, supports this legislation, citing low submission rates and lack of awareness among small businesses as key concerns. The Corporate Transparency Act, originally aimed at combating money laundering, has faced criticism for its short reporting timeframe. While a similar bill (H.R. 5119) passed the House in 2023 with ADA support, it remains stalled in the Senate. The proposed delay aims to prevent potential fines and legal consequences for small business owners who may be unaware of or unprepared for the current year-end 2024 deadline.</p>

            <p class="article-meta"><strong>Olivia Anderson - September 13, 2024</strong></p>
            <p>The House of Representatives' subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor and Pensions held a hearing on September 10, 2024, to discuss the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) on its 50th anniversary, focusing on protecting and improving the regulation of self-funded benefit plans, including dental insurance. The American Dental Association (ADA) submitted comments emphasizing the importance of limiting ERISA preemption to maintain states' authority in regulating dental insurers. The hearing, chaired by Rep. Bob Good (R-Va.), featured four policy experts discussing ways to strengthen ERISA while balancing government intervention in healthcare markets. The ADA argued that expanding ERISA preemption could create regulatory vacuums and negatively impact healthcare delivery, urging that preemption be limited to areas expressly concerned with ERISA, such as reporting, disclosure, and fiduciary responsibility. This debate highlights the ongoing tension between federal oversight and state authority in healthcare regulation, with potential implications for how dental and health insurance is managed across the United States.</p>

            <p class="article-meta"><strong>Olivia Anderson - September 11, 2024</strong></p>
            <p>This article focuses on Dr. Natalia Chalmers, the first chief dental officer for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in the Office of the Administrator. Dr. Chalmers, a pediatric dentist with over 20 years of experience, was appointed to this role in August 2021. Her primary goals include improving oral health care, policy, and addressing disparities in access to dental care across the United States. The article highlights Dr. Chalmers' extensive background, including her education in Bulgaria, residency at the University of Maryland, and various roles at institutions such as the FDA and NIDCR. Since joining CMS, Dr. Chalmers has launched initiatives like the Oral Health Cross-Cutting Initiative and helped modernize Medicare's dental claim processing. Looking ahead, she hopes to see oral health recognized as an essential element of overall health and aims to implement policy changes to improve access to care and reduce oral health disparities.</p>

            <p>The Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA) is seeking public input on proposed revisions to various dental accreditation standards through a virtual hearing and an online portal. The main topic revolves around updating standards for several dental education programs, including predoctoral, advanced general dentistry, general practice residency, dental hygiene, and orofacial pain education. CODA has scheduled a virtual hearing for October 10, 2024, from 5-6 p.m. CDT, where interested parties can comment on the proposed changes after registering. Additionally, stakeholders can submit comments online until December 1, 2024, for most standards, with the exception of orofacial pain education program standards, which have a deadline of June 1, 2025. This process aims to gather comprehensive feedback from the dental community to ensure the standards reflect current industry needs and best practices.</p>
