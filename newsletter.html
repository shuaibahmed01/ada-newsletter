                            <p>The Corporate Transparency Act's year-end filing deadline for small businesses, including many dental practices, may be delayed by one year under H.R. 9278, introduced by Rep. Zachary Nunn. The ADA and 150 trade associations support this legislation, citing low compliance rates and lack of awareness. The act, aimed at combating money laundering, currently requires businesses with fewer than 20 employees or under $5 million in annual revenue to file beneficial ownership information by the end of 2024.</p>

                            <p>The ADA submitted comments to CMS on proposed Medicare payment policies for dental services in 2025, continuing its three-year engagement on this issue. The ADA supports coverage for dental services related to end-stage renal disease and dialysis, while requesting clarification on diabetes-related care. The association advocated for delayed implementation of certain coding requirements until 2026 and proposed standardizing care coordination processes. The ADA commended CMS for recognizing oral health's importance in overall well-being.</p>

                            <p class="article-meta"><strong>Author:</strong> Olivia Anderson</p>

                            <p>The ADA is advocating against broad interpretation of ERISA that could limit states' authority to regulate dental benefits. In a letter to the House Judiciary Committee, ADA leaders argued that state regulation is essential for fair treatment of patients and market consistency. The debate stems from pharmacy benefit managers' attempts to use ERISA preemption to avoid state regulations, potentially impacting dental insurance oversight. The ADA urges Congress to reaffirm limits on preemption recognized in a 2020 Supreme Court case.</p>

                            <p>Two Connecticut dentists and their practices agreed to pay $1.7 million to settle allegations of violating federal and state False Claims Acts.

The settlement reimburses the Medicaid program for the improper conduct.</p>
