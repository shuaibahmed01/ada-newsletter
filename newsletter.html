                            <p>The ADA submitted comments to CMS on proposed Medicare payment policies for dental services in 2025, marking the third consecutive year of such feedback. The ADA supports coverage for dental services related to end-stage renal disease and dialysis, while requesting clarification on diabetes-related care. They suggested delaying certain administrative requirements and ICD-10 implementation until 2026, and proposed adopting a standardized referral form for care coordination. The ADA commended CMS for recognizing oral health's importance in overall well-being.</p>

                            <p>The ADA is advocating against broad interpretation of ERISA that could limit states' authority to regulate dental benefits. In a letter to the House Judiciary Committee, ADA leaders argued for preserving state regulation to ensure fair treatment of patients. The debate stems from pharmacy benefit managers' claims about ERISA preemption. The ADA cites the 2020 Rutledge v. PCMA case, urging Congress to reaffirm limits on preemption.</p>

                            <p>The Corporate Transparency Act's filing deadline for small businesses, including many dental practices, may be delayed by one year under H.R. 9278, introduced by Rep. Zachary Nunn. The ADA and 150 trade associations support this legislation, citing low submission rates and lack of awareness among affected businesses. The act, aimed at combating money laundering, currently requires filing by year-end 2024. The proposed delay addresses concerns about the short reporting timeframe for small businesses.</p>
